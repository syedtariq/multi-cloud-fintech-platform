# Microservices Architecture

## Core Trading Services

### Trading Engine Service
```yaml
Service: trading-engine
Replicas: 10-50 (auto-scaling)
Resources:
  CPU: 2-8 cores
  Memory: 8-32 GB
  Storage: NVMe SSD
Latency Target: <50ms
```

### Order Management Service
```yaml
Service: order-management
Replicas: 5-20
Resources:
  CPU: 1-4 cores
  Memory: 4-16 GB
Dependencies:
  - trading-engine
  - risk-engine
  - market-data
```

### Risk Engine Service
```yaml
Service: risk-engine
Replicas: 3-10
Resources:
  CPU: 2-6 cores
  Memory: 8-24 GB
Real-time: Position monitoring
Alerts: Risk threshold breaches
```

### Market Data Service
```yaml
Service: market-data
Replicas: 5-15
Resources:
  CPU: 1-4 cores
  Memory: 4-12 GB
Data Sources:
  - External market feeds
  - Kinesis streams
  - WebSocket connections
```

## Service Communication

### Synchronous Communication
```
API Gateway → gRPC → Service Mesh (Istio)
    ↓
Load Balancing → Circuit Breakers → Retry Logic
    ↓
Service Discovery → Health Checks
```

### Asynchronous Communication
```
Event Publisher → SQS/SNS → Event Consumer
    ↓
Dead Letter Queue → Error Handling
    ↓
Event Store → Audit Trail
```

## Service Mesh Configuration

### Istio Service Mesh
```yaml
Traffic Management:
  - Canary deployments
  - Blue-green deployments
  - Traffic splitting
  - Fault injection

Security:
  - mTLS between services
  - JWT validation
  - RBAC policies
  - Network policies

Observability:
  - Distributed tracing
  - Metrics collection
  - Access logging
  - Service topology
```

## Auto-Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
```yaml
Metrics:
  - CPU utilization: 70%
  - Memory utilization: 80%
  - Custom metrics: Queue depth
  - Request rate: Requests/second

Scaling Behavior:
  - Scale up: 2x pods every 30s
  - Scale down: 50% pods every 5min
  - Min replicas: 3
  - Max replicas: 100
```

### Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
```yaml
Resource Optimization:
  - CPU right-sizing
  - Memory optimization
  - Cost reduction
  - Performance tuning
```

### Cluster Autoscaler
```yaml
Node Scaling:
  - Scale up: New nodes in 60s
  - Scale down: Remove unused nodes
  - Instance types: Mixed (spot + on-demand)
  - Max nodes: 200 per AZ
```

## Data Persistence Strategy

### Database per Service
```
trading-engine → Aurora PostgreSQL (OLTP)
market-data → DynamoDB (NoSQL, high throughput)
user-management → Aurora MySQL (OLTP)
analytics → Redshift (OLAP)
audit-logs → S3 + Athena (Archive)
```

### Caching Strategy
```
L1 Cache: Application-level (in-memory)
L2 Cache: Redis cluster (distributed)
L3 Cache: CloudFront (CDN)
Cache Patterns: Write-through, Read-aside
TTL: Service-specific (1s - 1h)
```

## Service Dependencies

### Critical Path Services
```
User Request → API Gateway → Order Management
                                ↓
                           Trading Engine
                                ↓
                           Risk Engine
                                ↓
                           Market Data
```

### Supporting Services
```
Authentication → User Management
Notifications → Message Service
Reporting → Analytics Service
Monitoring → Observability Stack
```
